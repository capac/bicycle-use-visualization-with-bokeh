## Data visualization for average weekday public bicycle traffic in London UK

I've dedicated some time to build an interactive scatter plot with [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) to show average weekday bicycle traffic in London UK. The interactive plot shows the total and net traffic flux for 935 docking stations, in increments of fifteen minutes, with the size displaying the sum of the inflow and outflow traffic from each station and the color showing the net flux of the infow and outflow traffic.

The data is freely available and can be downloaded from [the public open data web site for TfL](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/). The CSV file I've used is located in the data folder. Check out the visualization in the link below.
